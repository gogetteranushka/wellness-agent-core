Diabetes Mellitus
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A chronic condition marked by high blood glucose levels resulting from either deficient insulin production or the body's resistance to insulin's action. Type 1 diabetes involves insufficient insulin production, whereas Type 2 diabetes, the most common form, involves insulin resistance and often presents without symptoms.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) occurs due to decreased insulin production or cellular resistance to insulin. Type 2 diabetes is commonly linked to excess body fat. Notably, individuals of Asian descent may be at risk at a lower Body Mass Index (BMI) compared to Caucasians.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Potential complications include nephropathy (kidney disease), neuropathy (nerve damage), retinopathy (eye damage), and peripheral vascular disease. It also increases the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and complications during pregnancy.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Key concerns include managing high blood sugar, addressing overweight/obesity or being underweight at diagnosis, preventing the development of atherosclerosis, and improving unhealthy dietary patterns. Stress and low physical activity are also contributing factors.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The primary goals are to achieve and maintain normal blood glucose levels, prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), maintain an optimal BMI, and prevent the onset of other related complications.

Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
Results from the narrowing or blockage of the heart's coronary arteries, primarily due to atherosclerosis. It is a leading cause of death and can present as angina (chest pain), myocardial infarction (heart attack), sudden death, or heart failure.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause, involving the buildup of fatty deposits (plaque) in the artery walls. A high intake of saturated fat increases LDL ("bad") cholesterol, which contributes to plaque formation, blood clots, inflammation, and the overall risk of CHD.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Major complications include angina, heart attacks, heart failure, stroke, and sudden death. Key risk factors are smoking, hypertension, low HDL ("good") cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol, and diabetes. Other contributing factors include age, family history, obesity, physical inactivity, a high-fat diet, stress, and excessive alcohol consumption.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Dietary issues include high intake of saturated and trans fats, refined sugars, and processed foods, coupled with low dietary fiber intake.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The main objectives are to lower LDL cholesterol, increase dietary fiber, manage weight, and consume balanced nutrients to lower CVD risk. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and other plant-based foods is encouraged.

Hypertension
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A chronic medical condition characterized by persistently high blood pressure, defined as a reading of 140/90 mmHg or higher. It is often called a "silent" condition as it typically has no symptoms.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Caused by an increase in the resistance of blood vessels to the flow of blood. This can be due to various factors, including arterial stiffness, kidney dysfunction, or hormonal imbalances.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Major health risks include stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and kidney damage.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Key dietary contributors are excess sodium intake, low potassium intake, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The primary aims are to control blood pressure, reduce cardiovascular risk, lower sodium intake, increase potassium intake, and encourage the maintenance of a healthy weight.

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A condition characterized by the gradual loss of kidney function over time. It is typically classified into five stages, with stage 5 representing end-stage renal failure.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Progressive damage to the kidneys reduces their ability to filter waste, leading to a buildup of fluid and toxins in the body.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Complications include anemia, electrolyte imbalances, heart disease, and bone disorders.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Dietary management focuses on controlling high protein loads, excess sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, and managing fluid intake.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
Key goals are to control protein intake, restrict dietary sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, and carefully manage fluid balance to ease the workload on the kidneys.

Liver Disease
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A broad term for various disorders affecting the liver, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and fatty liver disease.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Involves liver inflammation (hepatitis), scarring (fibrosis/cirrhosis), impaired bile metabolism, and the buildup of toxins.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Potential complications include ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen), hepatic encephalopathy (brain dysfunction due to liver failure), bleeding disorders, and malnutrition.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Patients may experience poor protein tolerance, vitamin deficiencies, and fat malabsorption.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
Nutritional therapy aims to prevent muscle wasting (sarcopenia), optimize energy intake, manage fluid retention, and avoid hepatotoxic substances like alcohol.

Gastrointestinal Disorders
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A range of conditions that affect the stomach and intestines, including peptic ulcers, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The underlying issues can include mucosal damage, inflammation, altered gut motility, and malabsorption of nutrients.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Risks include internal bleeding, nutrient loss, anemia, and dehydration.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Common issues involve sensitivity to irritating foods, lactose intolerance, gluten sensitivity, and fiber intolerance.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The primary goals are to support gut healing, prevent nutritional deficiencies, and manage symptoms through dietary modifications.

Cancer
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth that can affect various organs and tissues in the body.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Cancerous cells invade surrounding tissues, interfere with normal organ function, and can cause significant metabolic changes.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Complications include cachexia (severe muscle wasting), malnutrition, a suppressed immune system, bleeding, and obstruction of organs.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Patients often face increased protein and energy needs, changes in taste and smell, and difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The main objectives are to maintain body weight, optimize nutrient intake to support strength, and improve tolerance to treatments like chemotherapy and radiation.

Obesity
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A condition defined by excess body fat. For Asian populations, a BMI of 25 or greater is often considered obese. It is a major risk factor for numerous other chronic diseases.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Caused by a sustained caloric surplus (consuming more calories than are expended), often coupled with hormonal and metabolic dysfunction related to excess adipose (fat) tissue.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Obesity significantly increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, fatty liver disease, and hypertension.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Typically associated with overconsumption of energy-dense foods, low levels of physical activity, and poor fiber intake.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The primary goal is to achieve sustainable weight loss, improve metabolic health markers, and instill long-term healthy eating and lifestyle habits.

Osteoporosis
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A condition characterized by reduced bone mineral density and mass, leading to fragile bones and an increased risk of fractures.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Occurs when bone resorption (breakdown) exceeds bone formation. It is often linked to deficiencies in calcium and vitamin D.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
The main complication is fragility fractures, most commonly occurring in the hip and spine, which can lead to significant pain and disability.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Dietary risk factors include low intake of calcium and vitamin D, as well as excessive caffeine and salt intake, which can impair calcium absorption.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The focus is on optimizing calcium and vitamin D intake to support bone health and encouraging weight-bearing physical activity to stimulate bone formation.

Anemia
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A condition in which the blood has a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells (RBCs) or hemoglobin, impairing its ability to transport oxygen.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Can be caused by blood loss, poor dietary intake or absorption of essential nutrients (like iron, folate, B12), or as a complication of chronic disease.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Symptoms and risks include chronic fatigue, developmental delays in children, and increased strain on the heart.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Key concerns are low intake or poor absorption of iron, folate, and vitamin B12. Chronic bleeding can also be a contributing factor.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The primary goal is to replenish stores of iron, folate, and/or vitamin B12 to support the synthesis of hemoglobin and red blood cells.

Dyslipidemia
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A condition characterized by abnormal levels of lipids (fats), such as cholesterol and triglycerides, in the blood.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Typically involves high levels of LDL ("bad") cholesterol, low levels of HDL ("good") cholesterol, and/or high triglycerides, all of which increase the risk for cardiovascular disease.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Major risks include heart attack, stroke, and pancreatitis (if triglycerides are very high).

DIETARY CONCERNS
Often linked to a diet high in saturated and trans fats and excessive overall calorie intake.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The aim is to lower LDL cholesterol, raise HDL cholesterol, and promote a heart-healthy eating pattern.

Metabolic Syndrome
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
A cluster of conditions that occur together, including central obesity (excess belly fat), hypertension, high blood sugar, and abnormal lipid levels.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The core underlying issues are insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Significantly increases the risk for developing Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and fatty liver disease.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Associated with a diet high in calories, sugars, and saturated fats, with a low intake of fiber.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The goals are to promote weight loss, control the individual risk factors (blood pressure, blood sugar, lipids), and encourage a balanced, healthy eating pattern.

Thyroid Disorders
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
Conditions caused by abnormal levels of thyroid hormone, resulting in either hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) or hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Hypothyroidism leads to a slowed metabolism. Hyperthyroidism causes an increased metabolic rate and can have significant cardiac and neurological impacts.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Risks include significant weight changes, increased heart risk, chronic fatigue, and mood changes.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Iodine deficiency or excess can cause thyroid problems. The altered metabolic rate can also impair nutrient utilization.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The objectives are to support normal thyroid function, optimize iodine intake (without overconsumption), and manage energy intake to correspond with the metabolic rate.

Dysphagia
DEFINITION & OVERVIEW
The medical term for difficulty swallowing. It can affect people of any age but is particularly common in the elderly and in patients with neurological conditions.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
Caused by muscular or neurological impairment of the complex swallowing reflex.

COMPLICATIONS & RISKS
Major risks include aspiration pneumonia (from food/liquid entering the lungs), malnutrition, and dehydration.

DIETARY CONCERNS
Requires careful texture modification of food and liquids to prevent choking. There is a high risk of nutrient loss due to food refusal or modification.

NUTRITIONAL GOALS
The primary goals are to ensure safe swallowing, maintain adequate nutritional and fluid intake, and prevent aspiration.
