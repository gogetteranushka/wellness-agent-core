- Total approximately 78 grams per day
- Essential for fetal tissue development

Micronutrients:
- Iron: 35 mg per day (increased to meet expansion of blood volume and fetal needs)
- Folic acid: 500 mcg per day (critical for neural tube development)
- Calcium: 1,200 mg per day (for fetal bone development)
- Vitamin B12: Important especially for vegetarians
- Vitamin D, iodine, and other micronutrients also increased
