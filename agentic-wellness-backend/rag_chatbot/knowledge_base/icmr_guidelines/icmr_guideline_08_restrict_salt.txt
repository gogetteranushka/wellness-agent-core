GUIDELINE 8: RESTRICT SALT INTAKE

Principle:
Excessive salt (sodium chloride) intake is a major risk factor for high blood pressure, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases. Limiting salt consumption is essential for maintaining healthy blood pressure and preventing chronic diseases.

Recommended Intake:
- Adults: Maximum 5 grams (approximately 1 teaspoon) of salt per day
- This includes salt from all sources: cooking, processed foods, and added at the table
- Current Indian consumption averages 8-10 grams per day, well above recommendations

Why Reduce Salt:
- High sodium intake increases blood pressure
- Hypertension is a leading risk factor for heart disease and stroke
- Salt reduction benefits everyone, not just those with high blood pressure
- Taste preferences for salt can be modified over time

Major Sources of Sodium:
1. Added salt during cooking
2. Salt added at the table
3. Processed and packaged foods (chips, namkeen, pickles, sauces)
4. Preserved foods (canned, dried, salted)
5. Restaurant and fast foods
6. Bread, biscuits, and bakery products
7. Ready-to-eat meals

Strategies to Reduce Salt:

1. During Cooking:
- Use less salt gradually; taste buds adapt over time
- Measure salt instead of adding freely
- Add salt towards end of cooking to perceive more saltiness
- Use alternative flavorings: herbs, spices, lemon juice, garlic, ginger

2. At the Table:
- Remove salt shaker from dining table
- Taste food before adding salt
- Gradually eliminate habit of adding extra salt

3. Food Selection:
- Choose fresh, unprocessed foods
- Limit processed, packaged, and canned foods
- Read food labels for sodium content
- Avoid high-salt condiments (pickles, chutneys, sauces, papad)
- Select low-sodium alternatives when available

4. Cooking Methods:
- Use herbs and spices for flavor: cumin, coriander, turmeric, black pepper
- Incorporate tangy flavors: tamarind, lemon, tomatoes
- Enhance natural flavors through roasting and grilling
- Make fresh chutneys and dips instead of store-bought

Alternative Seasonings:
- Fresh herbs: coriander, mint, curry leaves
- Whole spices: cumin, mustard seeds, fenugreek
- Aromatics: garlic, ginger, onions
- Souring agents: lemon, tamarind, kokum, amchur
- Heat: green chilies, black pepper

Hidden Sodium Sources:
- Baking soda and baking powder (use in moderation)
- Monosodium glutamate (MSG) in Chinese foods
- Sodium-based preservatives in processed foods
- Cheese and processed dairy products
- Breakfast cereals and bread

Special Considerations:
- Children should consume even less salt (3 grams/day maximum)
- People with hypertension should be especially vigilant
- Sweating and heat exposure may require slightly more salt, but most Indians still consume excess
- Iodized salt should be used to prevent iodine deficiency

Benefits of Salt Reduction:
- Lower blood pressure
- Reduced risk of heart disease and stroke
- Better kidney health
- Reduced calcium loss from bones
- Improved overall cardiovascular health

Practical Tips:
- Gradually reduce salt; complete change takes 2-3 months
- Cook meals at home for better control
- Use salt substitutes with caution (may contain potassium)
- Be aware of hidden salt in unexpected foods
- Educate family members about importance of salt reduction
