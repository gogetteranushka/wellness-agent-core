DIET FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES

Introduction:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels. Dietary management is fundamental to preventing diabetes in at-risk individuals and managing the condition in those diagnosed.

Risk Factors for Diabetes:
- Family history of diabetes
- Overweight and obesity (especially abdominal obesity)
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Unhealthy diet high in refined carbohydrates and sugars
- Age above 40 years (risk increases with age)
- History of gestational diabetes
- Metabolic syndrome

Dietary Goals for Diabetes Prevention and Management:

1. Achieve and Maintain Healthy Body Weight:
- BMI 18.5-22.9 kg/m² (Asian standards)
- Even 5-10% weight loss significantly improves blood sugar control
- Focus on gradual, sustainable weight loss

2. Control Blood Glucose Levels:
- Aim for normal or near-normal blood glucose
- Prevent dangerous highs and lows
- Reduce HbA1c to target levels

3. Manage Lipid Profile:
- Control cholesterol and triglycerides
- Reduce cardiovascular disease risk

4. Maintain Healthy Blood Pressure:
- Target below 140/90 mmHg
- Diet plays crucial role in blood pressure control
